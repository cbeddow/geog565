Your project proposal should include a title indicating the topic, the names and roles (if using) of the group members, a problem statement, and a proposed solution design. Specifically

TITLE: 

MEMBERS: Sage Tezak, Sara Gregory, and Christopher Beddow

ROLES: (leave this out, as we're all trying to get some hands on, and it looks like we all need to be application designers anyway!)

PROBLEM STATEMENT (2-3 sentences, on the tool, what material we use, and how automation will be an improvement):

SOLUTION DESIGN:

1. What we want to be the end result
2. Brief description of the major steps in the process our tool goes through, step by step
3. What we need to use from Python (sets, geoprocessing, etc., estimated)
4. What outside materials we need (shapefiles for examples, references, existing tools like a geocoding app)
