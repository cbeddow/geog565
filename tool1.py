#copy and paste any of this code into your IDLE window and run as a script to test it
#if you create any new pieces of this in IDLE or ArcGIS, just copy and paste the new code
#after making a change, you can select "Create a new branch..." below, by the green button to make an alternate copy
#after making a change you can also select "Commit directly..." to overwrite the original file
#for error corrections its best to commit directly, but as we make big changes we should make branches
# we can then merge branches into the original script later as we decide they are official


import arcpy #this lets us use geoprocessing functions from ArcGIS, like an initial rule

print "GEOG 565"
print "Sage Tezak, Sara Gregory, & Chris Beddow" #these print lines are just a test

#next we will build off of an existing tool from ArcGIS and modify its script, using it as a template

#this is a test
